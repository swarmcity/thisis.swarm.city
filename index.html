                    Every human interaction has potential for conflict, and the less people know each other the more risk there is.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That’s why centralized <span>third party intermediaries</span> like Amazon and Uber were created, because it’s not possible to personally know everyone you want to interact with.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These third parties vouch for the people using their platforms, their reputation, so that users can transact without knowing each other. If users trust the platform they don’t have to trust each other.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem is, in order to do that they built complicated infrastructures that end up costing users a lot of money. Uber charges 30% or more! And on top of that, users have to provide a ton of personal information. It’s only a matter of time until they get hacked, so ultimately how can you trust third parties with your identity?

              </h2>
              <h4 class="subtext">
                Philosophy: In a nutshell, Swarm City makes it easy for people to use context specific marketplaces to transact in, or create their own. We call marketplaces “hashtags”. Users may also form decentralized communities to benefit from economies of scale, and earn reputation together through marketplace transactions. We call communities “hives”.

                <div class="card card-body">
                  <p class="mb-0"><span>Hashtags are marketplaces.</span></p>
                  <p>In the physical world people find goods and services in physical marketplaces, like stores and shops. In Swarm City people find goods and services in hashtags. Hashtags are context specific marketplaces, for instance #needaride is a rideshare context where riders can find drivers willing to get them from one location to another. Or #contractor is where homeowners can find plumbers and electricians to fix their house. Users earn reputation by transacting in a hashtag.</p>

                  <p>Not only that, Swarm City users are free to open and run their own marketplace by creating a hashtag. Just like a shop proprietor, the hashtag creator is responsible for making their marketplace an excellent place for business. They ensure that buyers and sellers, and service seekers and providers using their hashtag will have a great experience. They also handle any dispute that may arise in their hashtag.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0"><span>Hives are communities.</span></p>

                  <p>Hives are people who share values and resources Each person has a unique combination of genetics and experience, and because of this their skillsets vary. For this reason it benefits humans to band together and form communities, to  leverage the combined abilities and resources of all members. In Swarm City, these groups are called “hives”.</p>

                  <p>Hives are people who share values and resources, and work together to provide services. For example, a group of aligned rideshare drivers may form a hive, and that hive would provide rides in a hashtag. Each driver would earn hive reputation for every ride they provide as a hive member, and would give a small percentage of their earnings to the hive’s shared resource pool. Drivers benefit from organizing this way because their hive reputation will give them influence on how the resource pool will be spent; for example, pooled insurance and marketing.</p>

                  <p>Go <a href="https://press.swarm.city/hives-f4845639eccf" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about hives.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0"><span>Reputation shows what a user values.</span></p>
                  <p>Often in-person commerce is transparent because both parties can see the goods and payment method that make up the deal. But sometimes people transact without knowing each other, either in person or online. In those situations people need some way to establish trust, so they may have confidence that the person they’re dealing with and the transaction itself is above board.</p>

                  <p>In Swarm City users create contextual reputation by completing transactions in a marketplace (hashtag). As an example, riders and drivers who successfully complete a #needaride transaction both get #needaride reputation. Users gain reputation in each marketplace they transact, and that reputation is forever associated with their profile. Their reputation gets affixed to the blockchain, which means it’s permanent and absolute.</p>

                  <p>A user’s profile will show all the reputation they have acquired in hashtags and hives, and because of this, gives their transaction partners a general understanding of what types of things they value, and what types of things they’ve achieved competency in.</p>

                Technology: Swarm City gives people the ability to freely associate. Not even Swarm City can stop voluntary interactions. In order to do that we needed to build the platform with technology that offers censorship resistance. Here’s an explanation of some of that technology:

                  <p>A blockchain is a distributed public ledger. It is a continuously growing list of transactions which are cryptographically linked. Blockchains are important because they prove, with 100% certainty, that an exchange of value happened.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0"><span>Smart Contracts</span></p>
                  <p>Smart contracts are programs that facilitate exchange on a blockchain. When certain conditions are met, a smart contract automatically executes, and because they run on a blockchain they operate exactly as programmed without any possibility of censorship or fraud.</p>

                  <p>In order to create the deal in #needaride, the rider must agree to send funds into escrow. This ensures the rider will be a good actor.</p>

                  <p><span>Step 2:</span> A driver sees the request because she is searching #needaride for requests in her area. She agrees to the terms of the deal, and also puts funds into escrow. This ensures the driver will be a good actor.</p>

                      <p>The first thing  a user must do is establish their identity. In Swarm City, a user’s identity is their public/private keypair, also known as their wallet. The Terminal release gave users the ability to create their own wallet, send and receive Swarm City Tokens (SWT), and exchange Arcade City Tokens (ARC) for SWT at a 1:1 ratio.</p>

                      <p>In Swarm City, a Storefront is a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easier for users to interact in a marketplace. Marketplace owners will choose a Storefront that best fits the needs of their marketplace users. For instance, a rideshare marketplace would benefit from an interactive map, so the marketplace owner might choose a Storefront that includes one.</p>
